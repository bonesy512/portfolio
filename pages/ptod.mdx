The brain does not accept that death is related to us, we have this primal reaction when the brain gets information that links self to death, something that tells us it's not reliable, so we shouldnt believe it. The moment you gain this ability to look into your own future, you realise that at some point you’re going to die and there’s nothing you can do about it. 
#
Look around a room full of people and imagine everyone _dead_ and the building has been destroyed. Nothing is permanent and we will all die one day. Keep the inevitable prospect of death stored in the back of your head, this will revolutionize the way you live your life.

“It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live.”
― Marcus Aurelius
